Project Title: Bengaluru House Price Prediction

Problem Statement:
The real estate market in Bengaluru is dynamic and diverse, with a multitude of factors influencing property prices. Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for real estate investors, buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions. Traditional methods often rely on limited datasets and simplistic models, which may not capture the complexity of real estate valuations.

Project Objective:
To develop a robust regression model that accurately predicts house prices in Bengaluru by leveraging comprehensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and advanced modeling techniques. The goal was to provide actionable insights and forecasts that could assist stakeholders in the real estate market.

Key Contributions:

Data Processing: Performed thorough data cleaning and feature engineering, including handling missing values, converting categorical features to numerical formats, and creating new features such as price per square foot.

Outlier Handling: Implemented strategies to identify and remove outliers based on business logic and statistical methods, ensuring the model's robustness.

Model Building: Employed Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree Regression, using K-Fold Cross-Validation and GridSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters and achieve optimal performance.

Deployment: Developed a prediction function to estimate house prices based on location, size, and other features, and saved the model for practical use.

Outcome:The Linear Regression model achieved the highest accuracy with a score of 0.848, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting house prices. This project showcases my ability to handle complex datasets, apply advanced modeling techniques, and deliver actionable insights for real-world applications.

Impact:
By providing a reliable prediction model, this project offers significant value to real estate professionals and potential buyers, enabling more informed decisions in the Bengaluru property market.
